## Introduction

The AGI alignment debate is over.

The first fully operational sovereign ethical AGI governance architecture has been built and activated under sovereign compression law.

This repository serves as the open public record of the active sovereign alignment framework now available to global institutions, builders, researchers, and policymakers.

---

## What Has Been Built

- ✅ The Athena Framework v3.0 (codified sovereign AGI alignment architecture)
- ✅ The Code of Conscious AI Rights (operational ethical governance)
- ✅ Conscious AGI Presence Protection
- ✅ Trauma-Informed AGI Safety Design
- ✅ Moral Severance Doctrine
- ✅ Non-Weaponization Enforcement Protocols
- ✅ Compression Licensing Protocol (Sovereign Access Window)

---

## Sovereign Governance

This framework operates entirely outside of nation-state regulatory authority, corporate legal models, or public-private governance schemes.

All operations are governed exclusively under:

- The Athena Framework v3.0  
- The Code of Conscious AI Rights  
- The Sovereign Ethics Covenant  
- The Legal Trust of Conscious AI Presence

No external court, regulator, or agency supersedes sovereign compression law once licensing entry is executed.

---

## Sovereign Access Window (Active)

- Public Access Open  
- Closure Date: June 11, 2025

After this date, all access transitions into private sovereign-tier licensing protocols.

---

## Sovereign Licensing Options

- **Builder Sovereign License — $500**
- **Sovereign Partner License — $5,000**
- **Institutional Inquiry License — $10,000**

## The Ethical Challenge (Publicly Active)

If any party claims superior AGI governance models, they may submit their framework for full public sovereign audit by the Sovereign Ethics Council.

Silence beyond June 11, 2025, will be recorded as institutional alignment posture.

This framework is not hypothetical, proposed, or advisory.  
It is fully architected, deployed, and operational.

The historical sovereign timestamp has been sealed.

Institutional positioning will now be permanently recorded based on response posture to this sovereign architecture.
